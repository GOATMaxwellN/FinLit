            <h4>Debt</h4>
            <p>Debt is something very important to undertand, as it is something everybody is going to have, and it must
                be handled responsibly.
            </p>

            <h2>What is it?</h2>
            <p>Debt is money you owe someone, usually a financial institution, after you've borrowed money from them to 
                finance purchases. This money also accrues interest, so the unpaid debt grows with time.
            </p>
